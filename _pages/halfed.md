## AJA&D Doodles and Unfinished Projects
Straight from my notebooks, be inspired by goofy drawings of mermaids, cutesy couples, or doggos! I also have unfinished projects on here; they may be later categorized in other areas on the site when finished. This part of the site will constantly be re-invented, so be sure to save your favorites... or not. You do you, boo. IF you see a link on the website, i'm currently working through some coding kinks; so copy the link under the picture and throw it into a browser to watch.

>Dork1. Hand-drawn animation, using AnimationDesk. 26 frames. I'm currently working on cleaning it up, maybe adding more detail. Thanks to my muse and favorite dork(you know you are (; ) for being the inspiration!

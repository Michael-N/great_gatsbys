## AJA&D Doodles and Unfinished Projects
Straight from my notebooks, be inspired by goofy drawings of mermaids, cutesy couples, or doggos! I also have unfinished projects on here; they may be later categorized in other areas on the site when finished. This part of the site will constantly be re-invented, so be sure to save your favorites... or not. You do you, boo.

>Dork1. Hand-drawn animation, using AnimationDesk. 26 frames. I'm currently working on cleaning it up, maybe adding more deatil. Good practice for animatics in the future!

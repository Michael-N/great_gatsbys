## AJA&D Hand-Drawn Art
Drawn by hand, a few made in my art class, but a lot are just fun sketches and doodles. Drawings may be done in ink, pencil, or both.

>Not sure if it counts as a doodle or drawing... whatever it is, it's clored pencil, metallic marker, and ink.

>Doctor Motiff. Colored Pencil and ink.

>Lizard. Colored pencil. A really fun project, the point was to make both see-through & visible. I reccomend to other artists :)

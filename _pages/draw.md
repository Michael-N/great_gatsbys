## AJA&D Hand-Drawn Art
Drawn by hand, a few made in my art class, but a lot are just fun sketches and doodles. Drawings may be done in ink, pencil, or both.

>Lizard. Colored pencil. A really fun project, the point was to make both see-through & visible. I reccomend to other artists :)

>Robocelot. Original. Pencil and Ink.

>Not sure if it counts as a doodle or drawing... whatever it is, it's clored pencil, metallic marker, and ink.

>Doctor Motiff. Colored Pencil and ink.

![Wolf](/great_gatsbys/IMG_1150 (2).JPG)
>Wolf. Marker. Not my finest piece- what the heck with dog muzzles i don't understand- but i really like the colours :)

![Majora's Mask](/great_gatsbys/IMG_1149 (2).JPG)
>Majora's Mask. Colored pencil and ink. Based on Majora's Mask from Legend of Zelda, i added Zentangle elements.
